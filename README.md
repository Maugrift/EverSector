# README #

Welcome to the EverSector repository on Bitbucket! EverSector is a space-themed roguelike written in Java, using AsciiPanel for its display.

### Builds ###

Whenever new commits are pushed to the repo, Bitbucket Pipelines will generate a new build of the game. You can see the status of the latest build on the Overview page or the Pipelines page. The most recent build will always be posted to Downloads, though no sound files are included for the sake of file size. If you want to play with sound effects, download the audio.zip file from Downloads and unzip it to your assets folder.

Keep in mind that these builds probably won't be as stable as the main releases posted on itch.io. If you find a bug, please post it on the issue tracker or at certain links below.

### Contributing ###

Though EverSector does not rely on contributions, I will gladly accept reasonable pull requests. EverSector's issues and planned features are listed on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/nOsMSRe3), which can also be viewed from the Boards tab. If you are interested in contributing, I would recommend joining the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TZTEQTz) to discuss changes. Notable contributors will be credited in the game's README and receive a Contributor role on Discord.

Make sure all contributions are documented with JavaDoc comments where possible. If you have IntelliJ IDEA, please download the EverSector.xml code style from Downloads and apply it to files you change (default is Ctrl+Alt+L).
