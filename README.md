# README #

Welcome to the EverSector repository on Bitbucket! EverSector is a space-themed roguelike written in Java, using AsciiPanel for its display.

### Automatic Builds ###

Whenever new commits are pushed to the repo, Bitbucket Pipelines will generate a new build of the game. You can the status of the latest build on the Overview page or the Pipelines page. The most recent build will always be posted to Downloads, though no sound files are included for the sake of file size. If you want to play with sound effects, download the audio.zip file from Downloads and unzip it to your assets folder.

### Contributing ###

No contributions are expected, but if you are interested, feel free to submit a pull request. Notable contributors will be credited in the game's README and receive a Contributor role on the game's Discord server.

### Contact ###

You can contact the developer, Boldorf Smokebane, through most of the links on EverSector's [itch.io page](https://boldorf.itch.io/eversector).
