<h3>Changes to the Terms</h3>
Updates to the terms are applied retroactively to previous versions,

<h2>Guide</h2>
<h3>How to Play</h3>
EverSector is played entirely with the keyboard. Every action
you can
take is triggered by a keypress or combination of them. At almost any
time, you may press <span style="font-family: monospace;">?</span>
to see all
actions currently available to you. This list may change based on your
situation and&nbsp;items you may have.&nbsp;In popup windows
and
confirmation dialogs, <span style="font-family: monospace;">y</span>
or <span style="font-family: monospace;">enter</span>
is equivalent to "yes," <span style="font-family: monospace;">n</span>
means "no," and <span style="font-family: monospace;">q</span>
or <span style="font-family: monospace;">escape</span>
means "cancel." Sometimes "cancel" performs the same function as "no,"
though generally it can be used to leave the dialog without performing
an action. To navigate menus, use the arrow keys. In some cases, <span style="font-family: monospace;">wasd</span>, the VI
keys, and the number pad may also be used to navigate. The current
selection is often denoted by a blue highlight.<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
You begin in the central sector of the galaxy, a place free of pirates
and hostilities. To start earning credits, find a planet or asteroid
belt to mine, and sell the ore at a station. The number next to the ore
indicates its density, or how many units you will get from mining it.
You can use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">r</span>
key to automatically restock all of your resources at a station, as
well as selling ore. If you find yourself in a sector with no planets,
you will have to escape the sector by flying down past the outermost
orbit. From there, search for another station system (<span style="font-family: monospace;">#</span>). If you
happen to run out of fuel, you can try broadcasting a distress signal.
Once you have secured a source of income, you can choose to spend your
credits on various items. Soon your power will grow and you can embark
on your own path through the depths of space.
<h3>Goal</h3>
EverSector is, in some sense, a sandbox. There are no goals imposed
upon you, and you are given the freedom to play as you wish. The most
straightforward way to judge progress is by the credits you possess.
However, it can be much more fun to impose challenges upon yourself.
Become the leader of your faction, assassinate an enemy leader, claim
the entire galaxy for your faction, or upgrade your ship to its limits
and crush your foes. Now go forth, and shape the future of your galaxy!<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
