<h3>Source Code Terms</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Usage of the
game's source code is governed by a separate license. See <span style="font-family: monospace;">LICENSE.txt</span> in
the source code download for this license.
<h3>Changes to the Terms</h3>
Updates to the terms are applied retroactively to previous versions,
rendering the terms of older versions void. Updates are published
on the game's <a href="https://boldorf.itch.io/eversector">official
page</a>, and the latest terms can be

bound by the latest terms of use.</span>
<h2>Guide</h2>
<h3>How to Play</h3>
EverSector is played entirely with the keyboard. Every action
you can
take is triggered by a keypress or combination of them. At almost any
time, you may press <span style="font-family: monospace;">?</span>
to see all
actions currently available to you. This list may change based on your
situation and&nbsp;items you may have.&nbsp;In popup windows
and
confirmation dialogs, <span style="font-family: monospace;">y</span>
or <span style="font-family: monospace;">enter</span>
is equivalent to "yes," <span style="font-family: monospace;">n</span>
means "no," and <span style="font-family: monospace;">q</span>
or <span style="font-family: monospace;">escape</span>
means "cancel." Sometimes "cancel" performs the same function as "no,"
though generally it can be used to leave the dialog without performing
an action. To navigate menus, use the arrow keys. In some cases, <span style="font-family: monospace;">wasd</span>, the VI
keys, and the number pad may also be used to navigate. The current
selection is often denoted by a blue highlight.<br>
<h3>Interface Overview</h3>
<h4>Galaxy</h4>
The galaxy map shows you the layout of nearby sectors in your galaxy.
Each tile is a sector, though only some of them have star systems you
can enter. Any tile other than a dot is a star system and highlighted
sectors contain nebulae that block vision. You can also switch between
normal view and star view by pressing <span style="font-family: monospace;">v</span>. Normal view
colors sectors based on the faction that controls them and shows
systems with stations in them. Star view displays only star sizes and
colors. You can look around with <span style="font-family: monospace;">l</span> to what each
sector contains.
<h4>Sector</h4>
The sector interface is primarily a list of orbits with a comprehensive
list of their contents in the panel on the right. The uppermost orbits
are the closest to the star and lower ones are further away. Traveling
away from the star once at the furthest orbit will cause you to escape
the sector. The size of star determines the number of possible orbits
around it. You and other ships are displayed in the middle column, with
stations on the left and planets on the right. As with the galaxy map, <span style="font-family: monospace;">l</span> can be used
to look around and reveal the contents of different orbits.
<h4>Planet</h4>
The planet interface is a display of all regions on a planet. When
traveling around the planet, note that traveling east and west will
take you to the other side of the world. Traveling north or south over
a pole will take you to the opposite side of the planet, not to the
other pole. You can choose to show the colors of factions rather than
default region colors by pressing <span style="font-family: monospace;">v</span>. Also note
that solar arrays won't work on planets as most light exposure will be
inconsistent.
<h4>Station</h4>
The interface for stations lists items you can purchase on the left and
items you can sell on the right. To save time when mining, you can
press <span style="font-family: monospace;">r</span>
at a station to "restock," selling all ore and refilling other
resources. Docking with a station will automatically repair any damaged
modules you may have for no cost.<br>
<h4>Battle</h4>
The battle interface is a simple list of your allies and enemies.
Pressing one of the combat keys (as listed after pressing <span style="font-family: monospace;">?</span>) will perform
its action on the currently selected ship. You will be able to view the
information of ships you've scanned on a panel to the right. Note that
the more modules a ship has, the more likely one is to get damaged.
<h3>Goal</h3>
EverSector is, in some sense, a sandbox. There are no goals imposed
upon you, and you are given the freedom to play as you wish. The most
straightforward way to judge progress is by the credits you possess.
However, it can be more fun to impose challenges upon yourself.
Become the leader of your faction, assassinate an enemy leader, claim
the entire galaxy for your faction, or upgrade your ship to its limits
and crush your foes. Now go forth, and shape the future of your galaxy!<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
